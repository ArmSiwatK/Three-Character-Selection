# touhou-character-selection
I wanted to try something else, but I like how the project looks currently, so I might as well keep it around with Git â€“ and by extension, use GitHub.

Anyway, this is a simple React application that allows users to browse through a gallery of characters and select three of them. It provides a straightforward way to showcase and choose characters from a given list. This selection screen should work with any other set of characters, as long as the data format in characters.json and the naming of images in the public folder are adhered.
