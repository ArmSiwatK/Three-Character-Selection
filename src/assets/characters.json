    "description": "Reimu, the Hakurei Shrine Maiden, leads a life dedicated to exterminating youkai in Gensokyo. Positioned at the eastern border with the “Outside World”, the Hakurei Shrine sees scarce worshipers, allowing Reimu to pass her days leisurely sipping tea and pretending to sweep the grounds. When questioned about her motivation for battling youkai, she emphasizes that it is an integral duty bestowed upon the “Hakurei Shrine Maiden”, inseparable from the existence of Gensokyo itself."

    "description": "Marisa is a powerful human magician who exterminates youkai as if competing with Reimu. She lives in the Forest of Magic, where she runs the Kirisame Magic Shop. However, since the forest is inhospitable to normal humans, she hardly gets any customers. Because of that, most of her time is devoted either to magical research or visiting the Hakurei Shrine. She wears black clothes both because you can't tell when they're dirty, and because she thinks that's what magicians ought to wear."

She has the power to manipulate darkness and avoids sunlight, surrounding herself in a pitch-black shroud to keep it at bay. However, her darkness also blinds her and has limited range. Rumia is often seen aimlessly flying around Gensokyo. During full moon nights, she may appear outside of her darkness. The ribbon on her head is actually an ofuda, but its origin is unknown, and she cannot touch it herself."

    "description": "Although she does not have a specific name, for convenience, she is referred to as “Daiyousei” to distinguish her from the regular fairies. She makes her first appearance at Stage 2 of “Embodiment of Scarlet Devil”, where she is encountered while traveling over the Misty Lake. Fairies are generally cheerful, so she may have attacked the protagonists simply out of mischief. She also appears again at the Misty Lake stage in Great Fairy War, which means she probably lives in that area."

She seems to live near the Misty Lake in the foothills of the Youkai Mountain, though her exact dwelling is unknown. She has the ability to manipulate the cold and freeze anything (sometimes even danmaku). The cold is severe enough to instantly freeze small objects, and she seems to even emanate it while asleep."

However, Meiling does not rely on unusual abilities. Instead, she harnesses her expertise in martial arts, specifically the art of “Qigong”, allowing her to manipulate qi energy. Notably, her physical prowess aligns with her master, Remilia, suggesting a shared inclination towards the physical aspects of combat."

She first appeared as the Stage 4 Midboss in “Embodiment of Scarlet Devil” attacking the protagonist. From the perspective of Koumakan, the protagonist is an intruder, so Koakuma felt she had no choice but to attack this suspicious individual. While she is seen in the library, it is unclear whether or not Patchouli who summoned her as a familiar."

The library contains a vast collection ranging from magical grimoires to outside world books. Though the library is located in the mansion's dusty and moldy basement, Patchouli refuses to be separated from her books, even if her asthma can prevent her from reciting spells."

Her house is filled with her handmade dolls. While they do assist her in housekeeping, it isn't any less work given that she has to be the one moving them in the first place."

Suika, however, defied this trend and returned to Gensokyo, orchestrating a peculiar incident – a banquet held at the Hakurei Shrine every three days."
